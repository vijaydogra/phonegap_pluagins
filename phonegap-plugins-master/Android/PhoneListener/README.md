PhoneListener
============

**Modified by Matt McGrath to work on versions of PhoneGap 1.6 (cordova) upwards**

This plugin allows your application to monitor changes in the phone's state (RINGING, OFFHOOK and IDLE) so that you can respond to them appropriately (pause your Media stream, etc).

This plugin has been moved to [http://github.com/devgeeks/PhoneListener](http://github.com/devgeeks/PhoneListener)
